/**
 * Write a Circle class that has the following member variables: • radius: a double • pi: a double initialized with the value 3.14159
 * The class should have the following member functions: • Constructor.
 * Accepts the radius of the circle as an argument. • setRadius.
 * A mutator function for the radius variable. • getRadius.
 * An accessor function for the radius variable. • getArea. Returns the area of the circle, which is calculated as  area = pi * radius * radius • getDiameter. Returns the diameter of the circle, which is calculated as diameter = radius * 2 • getCircumference. Returns the circumference of the circle, which is calculated as circumference = 2 * pi * radius
 * Write a program that demonstrates the Circle class by asking the user for the circle’s radius, creating a Circle object, and then reporting the circle’s area, diameter, and circumference using const method.
 * A const method is declared as (return type methodname() const).
