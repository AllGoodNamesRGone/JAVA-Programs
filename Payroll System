/**
 * Design a PayRoll class that has data members for an employeeâ€™s hourly pay rate, number of hours worked, and total pay for the week.

 * The program should ask the user for the number of hours each employee has worked and will then display the amount of gross pay each has earned.
 * Do not accept values greater than 60 for the number of hours worked.
