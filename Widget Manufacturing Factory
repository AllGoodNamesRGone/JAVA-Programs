 * Design a class for a widget manufacturing plant.
 * Assuming that 10 widgets may be produced each hour,

 * (The plant operates two shifts of eight hours per day.)
 * Write a program that asks the user 
 * for the number of widgets that have been ordered and then displays the number of days it will take to produce them.
 * Input Validation:
 * Do not accept negative values for the number of widgets ordered.
